# Cells 

Simple cell population simulator.

Rules:

- Blue squares are food.  Cells can eat blue blocks if within a certain distance.
- If the cell has just eaten, it has the chance to divide into a random number of cells
- Eating randomly increases the lifespan of the cell
- Lighter colored cells are younger than darker colored cells
